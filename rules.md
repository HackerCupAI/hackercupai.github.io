# Rules

The rules of this competition aim to ensure fair evaluation and reproducible results. To this end, we require the following:


* Open Evaluation, Open Model: track submissions must be reproducible end-to-end on a system with a NVIDIA A100 GPU with 40GB of VRAM, no more than 128GB of RAM, and no more than 1TB storage. After the competition, all teams are required to open-source their code, and methodology and link to any used data. Competition organizers will reproduce all results for the top teams before declaring a winner. Participants are required to utilize open-source code, libraries, and datasets with proper attribution or open source their own after the competition.
* Open Evaluation, Closed Model: track submissions will not be reproduced but must provide an API endpoint for competition hosts to query with additional validation questions, with response times required to be less than 15 minutes. Submissions in this track may optionally (and are highly encouraged to) provide details of their systems, including model and infrastructure scale.
* Participants may compete either individually or within teams, without a limit on team size. However, joining multiple teams is strictly prohibited.
* Organizers and advisors affiliated with the competition are prohibited from participating and claiming prizes.
* Submissions must comply with responsible AI principles, explicitly forbidding content that could incite harm, discrimination, or engage in unethical behavior. 
* The competition operates on an honor system to foster a respectful and fair environment. Actions contrary to the spirit of the competition or otherwise unfair practices will lead to disqualification. This includes respectful communication within our Discord communities.
* The rankings are final, and the organizers reserve the right to disqualify any participant at their discretion.
* This competition will be governed by any additional rules as posted by the relevant Meta Hacker Cup site.
