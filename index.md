We are launching the first AI track for the popular Meta Hacker Cup programming
competition, designed to assess the capabilities of Generative AI in performing
autonomous code generation tasks. We aim to test the limits of AI in complex
coding challenges and measure the performance gap between AI systems and
human programmers. We will provide access to all Hacker Cup problems since 2011
alongside their respective solutions in a multimodal (image and text) format, and
utilize the existing Hacker Cup infrastructure for competitor evaluation. Featuring
both "open evaluation, open model" and "open evaluation, closed model" tracks,
this competition invites diverse participation from research institutions of varied
interests and resource constraints, including academic labs, AI startups, large
technology companies, and AI enthusiasts. Our goal is to develop and democratize
meaningful advancements in code automation with the very first open evaluation
process for competitive AI programmers.
